# R_from_scratch_notebooks

This repository contains **R Notebooks** created through **Google Collaborative**, using the R kernel.

It will be a series of simple exercises of data manipulation and visualization, most of them adapted from other courses. 
I will always try to refer the appropriate sources.

I hope you enjoy it, thanks.
